# ZMK ARTSEY Implementation

#my copy

This repo contains the [ZMK](https://zmkfirmware.dev/) ARTSEY implementation and pre-built firmware for boards that have been setup to use ARTSEY by the core ARTSEY development team.

## Prebuilt Firmware

The `Releases` area of this repository contains the latest builds of the ZMK ARTSEY implementation. You can click on the most recent release and download the appropriate artifact for your MCU + board combination. Inside the zip file will be the necessary file for flashing your MCU.

### Firmware Files

Inside the firmware zip file will be 4 files

- `artsey.dtsi`: The ARTSEY definition that was used for the build
- A file with `.dts.pre.tmp` at the end that is the generated DTS file used for the build (this is for any required troubleshooting)
- A file with `-zmk-artsey.hex` at the end that is the hex firmware image that can be used to flash your MCU
- A file with `-zmk-artsey.uf2` at the end that is the uf2 firmware image that can be used to flash your MCU

Please Note: the `hex` and `uf2` files may or may not be present depending on your MCU + board combo. **PLEASE** use the proper file for flashing your board. 

**We are NOT responsible for any failed firmware flashes!**

## Adding ARTSEY Support

If you'd like to add ARTSEY support to a board that supports ZMK but is not built by this repo. Please follow the standard ZMK docs on how to add a new shield but using this repo as your `zmk-config` and open a Pull Request.

Also, update the `.github/workflows/build.yml` file for the new board being submitted.

Note: This repo is setup with github actions so you *can* work directly via GitHub Actions similar to how the ZMK documentation outlines.
